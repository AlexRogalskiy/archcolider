# Constraints 

Below listed global constraints for the solution that drives all trade-off decisions: 

1. Developers team is small so the solution should be simple at the begining to proove business ideas 
2. Time-to-market is critical and with support of previous constraint it should be super simple to deploy
3. AWS is primary target platform for deployment 
4. Budget is very limited so OSS and tools provided by target platform should in prioritization

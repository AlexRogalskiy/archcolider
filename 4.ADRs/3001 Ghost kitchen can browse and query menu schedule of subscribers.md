Busines Driver nr: 3.001 - Ghost kitchen can browse and query menu schedule of subscribers

## Status

Proposed (Lukasz)

## Context

In order to catch up with demand supply problem. System should monitor orders (order in, order out). 
Furthermore, created orders hould be clasified between subscribed users and ocasional users.

## Decision

We'll allow "ghost kitchen" to filter order base on subscribed and unsubscribed users.

## Consequences

**Positive:** "ghost kitchen" has freedom over internal proritization of work.

# 1. Event sourcing usage

Date: 2020-10-30

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Food Farmacy works with external individual users and depends on reputation. In such an environment the time and accuracy of resolving users' complaints is essential. Thus, there should be a way to store all intermediate changes that are used. Keeping only the final state of a domain entity won't help to understand how we end up with a specific state.

The _ordering system_ going to evolve as the company grows and not all aspects clear at the beginning. There should be an option for graceful migration from one data model and data completeness to another.

User engagement is one of the business goals and there should be data for analysis of user's actions and behaviors to build a better model of new users engagement.  

## Alternatives

**Snapshot usage**

A widely-known approach that has been in use for years. There might be separated systems that logs users' actions and the most recent state of the correspondent entities. Usually. users' action not even recorded, and only the final state presented as a source of truth. In case of programmatically error for such an approach it's possible to get incorrect state of the entity, or impossible reconstruct the way how an entity ended up in a presented state. Application logs won't help much or will be too cumbersome to investigate a particular case.

From the other side such an approach is easy to implement and usually doesnâ€™t  require any special knowledge.

In case of recording all events and managing snapshots it requires manual management and correlating of those actions. We foresee unnecessary complexity in this case and a higher probability of making mistakes from a programming standpoint. Correlated transactional updates will have a significant impact on performance.

**Event sourcing**  

Quite a new approach for many developers. In fact some benefits and drawbacks were described for a snapshot usage. Without support of a dedicated tool for event sourcing a correct and convenient implementation will require time and followin support from the development team. If there will be a tool for handling eventstreams, building snapshots and sending notification for other parts of the system that something changes it would be very handy. Thankfully such a tool exists, it's the EventSource - OSS system for event sourcing.

There are some risks in adopting such a tool, but the benefits are much more promising in terms of having an immutable history of changes, automatic projections (snapshots) and notifying subscribers for specific events.

## Decision

Event sourcing approach gives us a full history of changes and can help investigate issues and user's complaints. With support of EventSource storage the main issue with synchronizing updates and read models seems manageable.

## Consequences

New system might be used in a suboptimal way until developers grasp the idea behind and adopt working patterns to a new paradigm.

Preferable start with SaaS solution to remove support and scale issues.

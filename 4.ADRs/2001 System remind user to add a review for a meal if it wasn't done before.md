Busines Driver nr: 2.001 - System remind user to add a review for a meal if it wasn't done before.

## Status

Proposed (Lukasz)

## Context

User should have means to create a menu from a meals that are offered by "ghost kitchen(s)".

## Decision

We wil create a feedback/recomendation system that allows user to rate and review meals. 
System will send reminder to a user to create a review for a meal if it wasn't done before. 
Review is optional!

## Consequences

**Positive:** Feedback will encurage users to compose own menus base on reviews. 

**Negative:** Not all feedback can be positive.

**Notes** Feedbak system can be user not only for a meal review, but as well as a reporting mechanism for other aspects of the system

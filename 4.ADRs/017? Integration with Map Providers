# Integration with Map Providers.

Date: 2020-11-24

## Status

Proposed 

## Context

Application should be integrated with 3rd party geo location providers to help user reach the Smart fridge to pick the meal

## Decision

Based on the business model (as there will be more subscribed users, who knows the location precisely ) we have decided to integrate with OpenStreet map API as its open-source , there will be No added expenditures for the business.

## Consequences

As OpenStreet map is a open-source there may be chance of limited or no support in future

Due to the nature of the project, excessive exchange of data through the API is not welcome, and users may get blocked without notice when making too many data requests.

## Governance

While maintaning the application, there is a need of constant surveillance on the support of maps

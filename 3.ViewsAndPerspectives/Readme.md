1. [User Scenarios](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/master/3.ViewsAndPerspectives/UserScenariosPerspective.md)
1. [Informational](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/master/3.ViewsAndPerspectives/InformationModels.md) - Describes the way that the architecture stores, manipulates, manages, and distributes information
1. [Concurrency](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/master/3.ViewsAndPerspectives/Concurrency.md) - Describes the concurrency structure of the system and maps functional elements to concurrency units to clearly identify the parts of the system that can execute concurrently and how this is coordinated and controlled.
1. [Deployment](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/master/3.ViewsAndPerspectives/DeploymentView.md) - Describes the environment into which the system will be deployed, including the dependencies the system has on its runtime environment
1. [Security](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/master/3.ViewsAndPerspectives/Security.md) - The security perspective guides you as you consider the set of processes and technologies that allow the owners of resources in the system to reliably control who can perform what actions on particular resources.
6. [Cost Analysis](https://github.com/ldynia/archcolider/blob/master/3.ViewsAndPerspectives/CostAnalysis.md) - Estimation of expenses for AWS cloud services.

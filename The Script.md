#1. Group Introduction

Good morning, Good afternoon and Good evening EVERYONE! ArchColider is a group of geeks whose members hold 5 different nationalities from two different continents. Despite cultural differences we share the same passion for software development, we believe in self-improvement and we would like to leave software a.k.a. world refactored. The final things that we have in common which allowed us to work efficiently was GMT+1 timezone, patient spouses, and kids who are asleep around 8pm. The name ArchColider was inspired by CERNâ€™s Large Hydron Collider (the geekiest thing that I know). We feared that colliding our thoughts and experiences will give birth to a new architecture that would assemble Service Oriented MonstroLith (hahaha) . Can you imagine our faces when we got the news that we were going to the semi-finals :) We are thrilled to present our solution and share it with you on GitHub.

# Group Introduction

Good morning, Good afternoon and Good evening EVERYONE! ArchColider is a group of geeks whose members hold 5 different nationalities from two different continents. Despite cultural differences we share the same passion for software development, we believe in self-improvement and we would like to leave software a.k.a. world refactored. The final things that we have in common which allowed us to work efficiently was GMT+1 timezone, patient spouses, and kids who are asleep around 8pm. The name ArchColider was inspired by CERN’s Large Hydron Collider (the geekiest thing that I know). We feared that colliding our thoughts and experiences will give birth to a new architecture that would assemble Service Oriented MonstroLith (hahaha). Can you imagine our faces when we got the news that we were going to the semi-finals :) We are thrilled to present our solution and share it with you on GitHub.

# Bussines Goal
Farmacy Food is a startup that aims to create tasty meals around peoples’ dietary needs. Farmacy food wishes to provide meals that are radically affordable and accessible. In order to do that Framacy Food has to collaborate with several stakeholders, including ghost kitchens (kitchen who cook the meals), point of sales (kiosk that holds smart fridges) and have a means to deliver meals to the smart fridge. It’s obvious that a startup needs software that will enable them grow. Like any startup it forecasts its user base, and has limited budget. The role of architect is to provide a solution that will respect business constraints and provide a solution that will allow Farmacy Food to achieve its goals.

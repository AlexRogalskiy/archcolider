# The goal: 

- Design ordering system for the end clients that will communicate with the rest of infrastructure and smart-fridges in particular. 

# Background: 

Company provide service for advicing and managing health nutrition for adult person (18-65 y.o. kids are in plans, but not in focus for now). Clients can subscribe for the service and get food according to their individual prescription. There are several distribution channels, and one of them is the smart-fridges. 

2 first locations in Detroit and 8 by 2021. 

## Smart-fridges capabilities 

Smart-fridges is like a food/drink kiosks that you can meet everywhere, but they are connected to company's backoffice. They have independent system and API. 

### Random 

In some point in time all that staff might be integrated with smart devices. But it requires a serious work with user's personal data. 

Fridges linkage - not thought about that, but it might be the case. Modularized system 

### Purchasing 

Via web-site and dedicated mobile application. 

### Authentication 

Currently by credit\debt card. User just swaping card and kiosk understand who is it. Auth based on last used card or pool of cards that are added to application. 

### Ordering 

Users should be able to make a personalized order upfront and get it later. In future plans, users should be able to browse entire catalog of available meals in fridges around them and order it. 

User should able "book" something if it is an open selling position. 

There might be option of setting pick-up time and notification that your meal arrived to a specific fridge. 

Non-subscribers can use smart-fridges as well

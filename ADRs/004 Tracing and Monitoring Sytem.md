# 1. Tracing and monitoring system

Date: 2020-10-29

## Status

Proposed 

## Context

This is a fast growing system and time fashioned scaling is essential. Also it allows to buy cheaper instances for services without overall degradation. 

## Alternatives 

### Datadog

### Graphana 

### Elasticsearch 

### AWS native tools

**Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** 

**AWS CloudTrail Logs**


## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

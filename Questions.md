# Question to the Owner 

## Subscribers 

1. If a subscriber can form a menu, then what is the maximum period of ordering upfront? A week, two weeks, a month?
2. Can a subscriber cancel a scheduled menu? When should it be accepted? What is the notice period? 
3. What if a subscriber didn't grab a daily meal? Can it be sold to others? After what time? How does a subscriber will be notified about it? 
4. What if a subscriber gets sick and can't grab meals for a one\several days?
5. What if a subscriber cancels a menu for a week. How should this situation be handled? Refund on a card or virtual account?  

## Ghost Kitchen 

1. How often should the kitchen get updates about on-demand orders and consumed meals? We are assuming that the kitchen does not work 24/7, and delivery also takes time and is scheduled in some way or another. It's also related to supply refills for the kitchen; that's why this is an important question. 

## Meal reservation and "on-demand" ordering 

1. Can registered users create a batch order that won't fit in a fridge? What then? Direct delivery? 
2. What is the system behavior if the catalog of meals becomes stale and a user ordered out of stock for a particular fridge meal?  
3. What is the time frame for the "on-demand" ordering? We think it is a legal case when the catalog shows a meal that can be cooked, but for now out of stock. And user can order it for delivery. For instance: if I order a meal in the morning, can I get it during lunch? Or all on-demand orders can be executed only on the next day? 

## General clarification 

1. We had a feeling that the following requirements out of the scope of the Ordering system (it even sound like an environment description): 
- Must integrate with 3rd party smart fridges to obtain inventory and purchase activity
- Smart Fridges Produce item inventory levels and purchases. The smart fridges have a cloud-based management system that handles communication with the Smart Fridge so obtaining this data would be through an API.

Because during the introductory session, it was mentioned that the smart-fridge system totally independent of the required one and already established. So the smart-fridges system provides API for all of them. Could you please clarify it? Do we right, or there some other intentions behind those sentences? 


Can the catalog contain meals out of order but with general availability for ordering within some time frame?
How often data should be updated?

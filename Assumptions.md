# Assumptions

## Smart fridges

1. We assume that there are methods that allows us to know about current stock, dispatching, time of refilment and so on. 
2. Stock refilment happens one-two times per day at roughly predictable time. It happens because of physical ability to deliver meals based on demand, traffic situation, ghost kitchen payloads. 

## Ghost Kitchen 

1. Ghost kitchen can provide feedback about order executing, like: accepted, dispatched, can't do, delayed
2. Ghost kithcen do not work 24/7 and prepare orders recieved at the begining of the working day.
